# Microsoft Excel Superstore Analysis

## Business Overview
Superstores retail businesses of various sizes, ranging from small to large, offering a diverse range of items at competitive prices to both local and global customers. It is essential for store owners to consistently monitor the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of their establishments to ensure they can make well-informed business decisions. The global superstore sales dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle. The data comprises sales data for three product categories: Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology, which are sold to three types of customers (Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office) across various geographical locations.

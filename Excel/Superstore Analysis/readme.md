# Microsoft Excel Superstore Analysis

## Business Overview
Superstores retail businesses of various sizes, ranging from small to large, offering a diverse range of items at competitive prices to both local and global customers. It is essential for store owners to consistently monitor the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of their establishments to ensure they can make well-informed business decisions. The global superstore sales dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle. The data comprises sales data for three product categories: Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology, which are sold to three types of customers (Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office) across various geographical locations.

## Main Goals
The goal of this project is to perform a detailed analysis of the Superstone sales dataset using Microsoft Excel. Superstore is a fictional company that sells various products, including furniture, office supplies, and technology equipment. The dataset includes information on customer demographics, product categories, sales amounts, and other related information.

## Key Steps in This Project
- Data Preparation and Cleansing: In this step, i imported the Superstore sales dataset into Microsoft Excel and performed some data preparation and cleansing tasks to ensure the data was accurate and consistent.
- Pivot Tables: Utilize pivot tables to summarize and analyze data for visualization.
- Visualizations and Dashboard Creation: Build visualizations using recommended charts to represent key insights.
- Sales Analysis: In this step, I use the reports and dashboards created in the previous step to analyze the Superstore sales data. I explore the sales data by product categories, customer segments, and regions to identify trends and insights that can help Superstone improve its sales performance.

## Business Questions
1. Which segment is best seller?
2. Analysing sales and order over the year 2011–2014
3. Which sub-categories sell the most?
4. Who are the Top 10 Customers of the Superstore?
5. What are the Top 10 States with the highest number of orders?
6. What is the most profitable region?
7. What are the top 10 most selling Products?
8. What is the most preferred Ship Mode?

## Data Preparation and Cleansing
Two common data cleaning tasks are performed on the dataset. Common issues such as identifying missing data(empty cells), misspellings, duplicate data were sorted to ensure the integrity of the data. Excel offers built-in features for both of these tasks. To address the first task, the “Go To” feature is used to locate blank cells. It can be accessed by navigating to Home > Find & Select > Go To Special in the ribbon. Subsequently, choose the Blanks option from the Go To Special pop-up window and click OK to apply the selection. Columns were formatted with prices set to the currency, order and ship dates columns set to the short date format and others converted to correlate with their corresponding data types.

For the second task, the “Remove Duplicates” feature is utilized to check and eliminate any duplicated rows from the dataset. To do this, navigate to Data > Remove Duplicates in the Data Tools group.

The result indicates that no duplicate values were found.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
In this section, pivot tables are extensively utilized to quickly extract, summarize, and report the findings for the business questions. The analyzed data is also visualized through various Excel charts.

Q1. Which segment is best seller?
   
From the "Top Segment" bar graph, it can be seen that the "Consumer" segment dominates with sales reaching around 6,800,000. The "Corporate" segment comes in second with sales of around 4,000,000, while the "Home Office" segment has the least sales, at around 2,000,00.

The company may consider expanding product offerings or marketing strategies aimed at the Consumer segment to maintain and increase sales.

Q2. Which sub-categories sell the most?
This sub-category shows that products related to organisation and storage are in high demand. This could be due to the ongoing needs of offices and schools. Increasing the variety of products in this sub-category, offering bundling or saving packages, as well as providing special promotions can boost sales further. In addition, identifying seasonal trends or specific needs can help in optimising stock and product offerings.

Q3. What are top 10 selling products?
Based on the sales analysis findings, it is evident that almost all the products in the top 5 list fall under the Office Supplies category. This correlates with the second top segment, which is corporate. Products such as Staples, Cardinal Index Tab, Clear, Eblon Flar Clic, Single Width, Rogers File Cart, Single Width, and Sanford Pencil Sharpener, Value Pack are mainstays in fulfilling daily operational needs in the work environment. High sales may also come from individual consumers such as students who need the products for their daily activities while the corporate segment tends to buy in bulk for use by their employees.

Q8. What is the most preferred Ship Mode?
Standard Class being the top choice is probably due to the balance between lower shipping costs and acceptable delivery times. This shows that customers tend to look for economical yet efficient options to receive their goods.

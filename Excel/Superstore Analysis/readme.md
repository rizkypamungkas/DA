# Microsoft Excel Superstore Analysis

## Business Overview
Superstores retail businesses of various sizes, ranging from small to large, offering a diverse range of items at competitive prices to both local and global customers. It is essential for store owners to consistently monitor the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of their establishments to ensure they can make well-informed business decisions. The global superstore sales dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle. The data comprises sales data for three product categories: Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology, which are sold to three types of customers (Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office) across various geographical locations.

## Main Goals
The goal of this project is to perform a detailed analysis of the Superstone sales dataset using Microsoft Excel. Superstore is a fictional company that sells various products, including furniture, office supplies, and technology equipment. The dataset includes information on customer demographics, product categories, sales amounts, and other related information.

## Key Steps in This Project
- Data Preparation and Cleansing: In this step, i imported the Superstore sales dataset into Microsoft Excel and performed some data preparation and cleansing tasks to ensure the data was accurate and consistent.
- Pivot Tables: Utilize pivot tables to summarize and analyze data for visualization.
- Visualizations and Dashboard Creation: Build visualizations using recommended charts to represent key insights.
- Sales Analysis: In this step, I use the reports and dashboards created in the previous step to analyze the Superstore sales data. I explore the sales data by product categories, customer segments, and regions to identify trends and insights that can help Superstone improve its sales performance.

## Business Questions
1. Which segment is best seller?

## Data Preparation and Cleansing
Two common data cleaning tasks are performed on the dataset. Common issues such as identifying missing data(empty cells), misspellings, duplicate data were sorted to ensure the integrity of the data. Excel offers built-in features for both of these tasks. To address the first task, the “Go To” feature is used to locate blank cells. It can be accessed by navigating to Home > Find & Select > Go To Special in the ribbon. Subsequently, choose the Blanks option from the Go To Special pop-up window and click OK to apply the selection. Columns were formatted with prices set to the currency, order and ship dates columns set to the short date format and others converted to correlate with their corresponding data types.

For the second task, the “Remove Duplicates” feature is utilized to check and eliminate any duplicated rows from the dataset. To do this, navigate to Data > Remove Duplicates in the Data Tools group.

The result indicates that no duplicate values were found.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
In this section, pivot tables are extensively utilized to quickly extract, summarize, and report the findings for the business questions. The analyzed data is also visualized through various Excel charts.

Q1. Which segment is best seller?
![Alt Text](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1CDg7hKxcKSCJ8l9wvoX6gwFK12Gxm5H1)

From the "Top Segment" bar graph, it can be seen that the "Consumer" segment dominates with sales reaching around 6,800,000. The "Corporate" segment comes in second with sales of around 4,000,000, while the "Home Office" segment has the least sales, at around 2,000,00.

The company may consider expanding product offerings or marketing strategies aimed at the Consumer segment to maintain and increase sales.

Q2. What is the year-on-year growth trend in profits and losses?

Based on the visualisation, there was a consistent positive trend in superstore profits and a decrease in losses from 2011 to 2014. Profit increased sharply from around 450,000 in 2011 to 800,000 in 2014, indicating improved operational efficiency and a successful business strategy. In contrast, loss decreased from -400,000 to -300,000, reflecting the superstore's ability to gradually reduce losses. This trend shows that the superstores are able to adapt well to market changes and customer needs, and continue to grow sustainably.

Q3. Analysis sales profit by each category over the year 2011 - 2014.

Furniture: This category showed steady growth year-on-year, with a significant increase in 2014. This could indicate an increase in demand or a better sales strategy that year.

Office Supplies: Although the growth was not as large as the other two categories, this category still showed a consistent increase. This indicates stability and continued demand in this category.

Technology: This category has consistently had the highest profits every year. This trend shows that technology is the most profitable sector, likely due to continued innovation and high market demand.

Q4. Which sub-categories sell the most?

This sub-category shows that products related to organisation and storage are in high demand. This could be due to the ongoing needs of offices and schools. Increasing the variety of products in this sub-category, offering bundling or saving packages, as well as providing special promotions can boost sales further. In addition, identifying seasonal trends or specific needs can help in optimising stock and product offerings.

Q5. What are top 10 selling products?

Based on the sales analysis findings, it is evident that almost all the products in the top 5 list fall under the Office Supplies category. This correlates with the second top segment, which is corporate. Products such as Staples, Cardinal Index Tab, Clear, Eblon Flar Clic, Single Width, Rogers File Cart, Single Width, and Sanford Pencil Sharpener, Value Pack are mainstays in fulfilling daily operational needs in the work environment. High sales may also come from individual consumers such as students who need the products for their daily activities while the corporate segment tends to buy in bulk for use by their employees.

Q6. What products have suffered losses?

This list provides information on products that have incurred heavy losses, which may require improvement strategies or further evaluation to reduce future losses. To address this, companies need to conduct a thorough review of their pricing strategy and appropriate marketing efforts. Product innovation can also be a solution by increasing added value and appeal to consumers. Also consider reducing stocks of products that have underperformed sales to reduce losses.

Q7. What are the Top 10 States with highest profit?

Four of the top ten states with the highest profits are in the United States, namely California, New York, Washington, and Michigan, indicating that these states are in very high demand and a highly potential market. 

The rest of the states on this list come from various countries, including the UK with regions such as England, France with Île-de-France, Germany with North Rhine-Westphalia, and Australia with New South Wales and Queensland. In addition, there is one state from El Salvador, San Salvador, which also shows considerable market potential despite being located in Central America.

Q8. Top 10 Consumer Countries

Although England was recorded as the most profitable state, the United Kingdom could not beat the United States as the most profitable country in this regard. When viewed from the perspective of the country as a whole, this may be due to a more varied distribution of customers among the various states in the United States, as well as a larger population compared to the United Kingdom.

Q9. Which region had the highest profit in the last year?

The Central Region recorded the highest total sales among all regions in the last year of 2014. However, there are challenges in the very slow business growth in the Canadian region. Therefore, the business team needs to put greater focus on growing the business in the region. This move is expected to optimise the market potential in Canada and increase Superstore's overall contribution in the long run.

Q10. Who are the loyal customers at the Superstore?

These customers have shown high loyalty to the company's products by placing large orders. Future strategies can focus on maintaining good relationships with these customers through superior customer service, as well as expanding the range of products they are interested in. Better identifying their preferences can help in crafting more targeted marketing strategies, including special promotions and rewards for their loyalty.

Q11. What is the most preferred Ship Mode?

Standard Class being the top choice is probably due to the balance between lower shipping costs and acceptable delivery times. This shows that customers tend to look for economical yet efficient options to receive their goods.
